  <description summary="Protocol for creating input methods">
    This protocol allows applications to act as input methods for compositors.

    An input method context is used to manage the state of the input method.

    Text strings are UTF-8 encoded, their indices and lengths are in bytes.

    This document adheres to the RFC 2119 when using words like "must",
    "should", "may", etc.

    Warning! The protocol described in this file is currently in the
    experimental phase. Backwards incompatible major versions of the
    protocol are to be expected. Exposing this protocol without an opt-in
    mechanism is discouraged.

  <interface name="xx_input_method_v1" version="1">
    <description summary="input method">
      An input method object allows for clients to compose text.

      The objects connects the client to a text input in an application, and
      lets the client to serve as an input method for a seat.

      The xx_input_method_v1 object can occupy two distinct states: active and
      inactive. In the active state, the object is associated to and
      communicates with a text input. In the inactive state, there is no
      associated text input, and the only communication is with the compositor.
      Initially, the input method is in the inactive state.

      Requests issued in the inactive state must be accepted by the compositor.
      Because of the serial mechanism, and the state reset on activate event,
      they will not have any effect on the state of the next text input.

      There must be no more than one input method object per seat.
    </description>

    <event name="activate">
      <description summary="input method has been requested">
        Notification that a text input focused on this seat requested the input
        method to be activated.

        This event serves the purpose of providing the compositor with an
        active input method.

        This event resets all state associated with previous enable, disable,
        surrounding_text, text_change_cause, and content_type events, as well
        as the state associated with set_preedit_string, commit_string, and
        delete_surrounding_text requests. In addition, it marks the
        xx_input_method_v1 object as active, and makes any existing
        zwp_input_popup_surface_v2 objects visible.

        The surrounding_text, and content_type events must follow before the
        next done event if the text input supports the respective
        functionality.

        State set with this event is double-buffered. It will get applied on
        the next xx_input_method_v1.done event, and stay valid until changed.
      </description>
    </event>

    <event name="deactivate">
      <description summary="deactivate event">
        Notification that no focused text input currently needs an active 
        input method on this seat.

        This event marks the xx_input_method_v1 object as inactive. The
        compositor must make all existing zwp_input_popup_surface_v2 objects
        invisible until the next activate event.

        State set with this event is double-buffered. It will get applied on
        the next xx_input_method_v1.done event, and stay valid until changed.
      </description>
    </event>

    <event name="surrounding_text">
      <description summary="surrounding text event">
        Updates the surrounding plain text around the cursor, excluding the
        preedit text.

        If any preedit text is present, it is replaced with the cursor for the
        purpose of this event.

        The argument text is a buffer containing the preedit string, and must
        include the cursor position, and the complete selection. It should
        contain additional characters before and after these. There is a
        maximum length of wayland messages, so text can not be longer than 4000
        bytes.

        cursor is the byte offset of the cursor within the text buffer.

        anchor is the byte offset of the selection anchor within the text
        buffer. If there is no selected text, anchor must be the same as
        cursor.

        If this event does not arrive before the first done event, the input
        method may assume that the text input does not support this
        functionality and ignore following surrounding_text events.

        Values set with this event are double-buffered. They will get applied
        and set to initial values on the next xx_input_method_v1.done
        event.

        The initial state for affected fields is empty, meaning that the text
        input does not support sending surrounding text. If the empty values
        get applied, subsequent attempts to change them may have no effect.

    <event name="text_change_cause">
      <description summary="indicates the cause of surrounding text change">
        Tells the input method why the text surrounding the cursor changed.

        Whenever the client detects an external change in text, cursor, or
        anchor position, it must issue this request to the compositor. This
        request is intended to give the input method a chance to update the
        preedit text in an appropriate way, e.g. by removing it when the user
        starts typing with a keyboard.

        cause describes the source of the change.

        The value set with this event is double-buffered. It will get applied
        and set to its initial value on the next xx_input_method_v1.done
        event.

        The initial value of cause is input_method.

        Values set with this event are double-buffered. They will get applied
        on the next xx_input_method_v1.done event.

        The initial value for hint is none, and the initial value for purpose

    <event name="done">
      <description summary="apply state">
        Atomically applies state changes recently sent to the client.

        The done event establishes and updates the state of the client, and
        must be issued after any changes to apply them.

        Text input state (content purpose, content hint, surrounding text, and
        change cause) is conceptually double-buffered within an input method
        context.

        Events modify the pending state, as opposed to the current state in use
        by the input method. A done event atomically applies all pending state,
        replacing the current state. After done, the new pending state is as
        documented for each related request.

        Events must be applied in the order of arrival.

        Neither current nor pending state are modified unless noted otherwise.

    <request name="commit_string">
      <description summary="commit string">
        Send the commit string text for insertion to the application.

        Inserts a string at current cursor position (see commit event
        sequence). The string to commit could be either just a single character
        after a key press or the result of some composing.

        The argument text is a buffer containing the string to insert. There is
        a maximum length of wayland messages, so text can not be longer than
        4000 bytes.

        Values set with this event are double-buffered. They must be applied
        and reset to initial on the next zwp_text_input_v3.commit request.

        The initial value of text is an empty string.

    </request>

    <request name="set_preedit_string">
      <description summary="pre-edit string">
        Send the pre-edit string text to the application text input.

        Place a new composing text (pre-edit) at the current cursor position.
        Any previously set composing text must be removed. Any previously
        existing selected text must be removed. The cursor is moved to a new
        position within the preedit string.

        The argument text is a buffer containing the preedit string. There is
        a maximum length of wayland messages, so text can not be longer than
        4000 bytes.

        The arguments cursor_begin and cursor_end are counted in bytes relative
        to the beginning of the submitted string buffer. Cursor should be
        hidden by the text input when both are equal to -1.

        cursor_begin indicates the beginning of the cursor. cursor_end
        indicates the end of the cursor. It may be equal or different than
        cursor_begin.

        Values set with this event are double-buffered. They must be applied on
        the next xx_input_method_v1.commit event.

        The initial value of text is an empty string. The initial value of
        cursor_begin, and cursor_end are both 0.

      <description summary="delete text">
        Remove the surrounding text.

        before_length and after_length are the number of bytes before and after
        the current cursor index (excluding the preedit text) to delete.

        If any preedit text is present, it is replaced with the cursor for the
        purpose of this event. In effect before_length is counted from the
        beginning of preedit text, and after_length from its end (see commit
        event sequence).

        Values set with this event are double-buffered. They must be applied
        and reset to initial on the next xx_input_method_v1.commit request.

        The initial values of both before_length and after_length are 0.

    <request name="commit">
      <description summary="apply state">
        Apply state changes from commit_string, set_preedit_string and
        delete_surrounding_text requests.

        The state relating to these events is double-buffered, and each one
        modifies the pending state. This request replaces the current state
        with the pending state.

        The connected text input is expected to proceed by evaluating the
        changes in the following order:

        1. Replace existing preedit string with the cursor.
        2. Delete requested surrounding text.
        3. Insert commit string with the cursor at its end.
        4. Calculate surrounding text to send.
        5. Insert new preedit text in cursor position.
        6. Place cursor inside preedit text.

        The serial number reflects the last state of the xx_input_method_v1
        object known to the client. The value of the serial argument must be
        equal to the number of done events already issued by that object. When
        the compositor receives a commit request with a serial different than
        the number of past done events, it must proceed as normal, except it
        should not change the current state of the xx_input_method_v1 object.

    <event name="unavailable">
      <description summary="input method unavailable">
        The input method ceased to be available.

        The compositor must issue this event as the only event on the object if
        there was another input_method object associated with the same seat at
        the time of its creation.

        The compositor must issue this request when the object is no longer
        useable, e.g. due to seat removal.

        The input method context becomes inert and should be destroyed after
        deactivation is handled. Any further requests and events except for the
        destroy request must be ignored.
