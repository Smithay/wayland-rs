/// The Wayland display
///
/// This struct is the core of your Wayland compositor. You'll use it in your event loop to drive the
/// protocol processing of all your clients. All other interactions with the protocol itself are done
/// through the [`DisplayHandle`] struct, on which the `State` type parameter is erased for convenience.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// The main loop of a Wayland compositor generally needs to wait on several sources of events, using
/// tools like `epoll` (on Linux). The Wayland display can be integrated in this mechanism by getting the
/// file descriptor as from [`.backend()`](Display::backend)[`.poll_fd()`](Backend::poll_fd) and invoking
/// the [`dispatch_clients()`](Display::dispatch_clients) method whenever it becomes readable.
///
/// To ensure all clients receive the events your compositor sends them, you also need to regularly invoke
/// the [`flush_clients()`](Display::flush_clients) method, which will write the outgoing buffers into the
/// sockets.
