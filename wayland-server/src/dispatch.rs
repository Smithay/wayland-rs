///
/// # Usage
///
/// For example, say you want to delegate events for [`WlOutput`](crate::protocol::wl_output::WlOutput)
/// to some other type.
///
/// For brevity, we will use the example in the documentation for [`DelegateDispatch`], `DelegateToMe`.

/// #
/// # struct DelegateToMe;
/// #
/// # impl DelegateDispatchBase<wl_output::WlOutput> for DelegateToMe {
/// #     type UserData = ();
/// # }
/// #
/// # impl<D> DelegateDispatch<wl_output::WlOutput, D> for DelegateToMe
/// # where
/// #     D: Dispatch<wl_output::WlOutput, UserData = Self::UserData> + AsMut<DelegateToMe>,

/// #         _dhandle: &wayland_server::DisplayHandle,
/// #         _data_init: &mut wayland_server::DataInit<'_, D>,
/// #     ) {
/// #     }
/// # }
///
/// // ExampleApp is the type events will be dispatched to.
///
/// /// The application state
/// struct ExampleApp {
///     /// The delegate for handling wl_registry events.
///     delegate: DelegateToMe,
/// }
///
/// // Use delegate_dispatch to implement Dispatch<wl_output::WlOutput> for ExampleApp.
/// delegate_dispatch!(ExampleApp: [wl_output::WlOutput] => DelegateToMe);
///
/// // But DelegateToMe requires that ExampleApp implements AsMut<DelegateToMe>, so we provide this impl
/// impl AsMut<DelegateToMe> for ExampleApp {
///     fn as_mut(&mut self) -> &mut DelegateToMe {
///         &mut self.delegate
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// You may also delegate multiple proxies to a single type. This is especially useful for handling multiple
/// related protocols in the same modular component.
///
/// For example, a type which can dispatch both the `wl_output` and `xdg_output` protocols may be used as a
/// delegate:
///
/// ```ignore
/// # // This is not tested because xdg_output is in wayland-protocols.
/// delegate_dispatch!(ExampleApp: [wl_output::WlOutput, xdg_output::XdgOutput] => OutputDelegate);
/// ```
