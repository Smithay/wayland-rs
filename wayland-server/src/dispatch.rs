/// A trait which provides an implementation for handling a client's requests from a resource with some type
/// of associated user data.
///
///  ## General usage
///
/// You need to implement this trait on your `State` for every type of Wayland object that will be processed
/// by the [`Display`][crate::Display] working with your `State`.
///
/// You can have different implementations of the trait for the same interface but different `UserData` type,
/// this way the events for a given object will be processed by the adequate implementation depending on
/// which `UserData` was assigned to it at creation.
///
/// The way this trait works is that the [`Dispatch::request()`] method will be invoked by the
/// [`Display`][crate::Display] for every request received by an object. Your implementation can then match
/// on the associated [`Resource::Request`] enum and do any processing needed with that event.
///
/// If the request being processed created a new object, you'll receive it as a [`New<I>`]. When that is the
/// case, you *must* initialize it using the [`DataInit`] argument. **Failing to do so will cause a **panic**.
///
/// ## Modularity
///
/// To provide generic handlers for downstream usage, it is possible to make an implementation of the trait
/// that is generic over the last type argument, as illustrated below. Users will then be able to
/// automatically delegate their implementation to yours using the [`crate::delegate_dispatch!()`] macro.
///
/// As a result, when your implementation is instanciated, the last type parameter `State` will be the state
/// struct of the app using your generic implementation. You can put additional trait constraints on it to
/// specify an interface between your module and downstream code, as illustrated in this example:
///
/// ```
/// # // Maintainers: If this example changes, please make sure you also carry those changes over to the
/// # // delegate_dispatch macro.
/// use wayland_server::{protocol::wl_output, Dispatch};
///
/// /// The type we want to delegate to
/// struct DelegateToMe;
///
/// /// The user data relevant for your implementation.
/// /// When providing delegate implementation, it is recommended to use your own type here, even if it is
/// /// just a unit struct: using () would cause a risk of clashing with an other such implementation.
/// struct MyUserData;
///
/// // Now a generic implementation of Dispatch, we are generic over the last type argument instead of using
/// // the default State=Self.
/// impl<State> Dispatch<wl_output::WlOutput, MyUserData, State> for DelegateToMe
/// where
///     // State is the type which has delegated to this type, so it needs to have an impl of Dispatch itself
///     State: Dispatch<wl_output::WlOutput, MyUserData>,
///     // If your delegate type has some internal state, it'll need to access it, and you can
///     // require it by adding custom trait bounds.
///     // In this example, we just require an AsMut implementation
///     State: AsMut<DelegateToMe>,
/// {
///     fn request(
///         state: &mut State,
///         _client: &wayland_server::Client,
///         _resource: &wl_output::WlOutput,
///         _request: wl_output::Request,
///         _udata: &MyUserData,
///         _dhandle: &wayland_server::DisplayHandle,
///         _data_init: &mut wayland_server::DataInit<'_, State>,
///     ) {
///         // Here the delegate may handle incoming requests as it pleases.
///
///         // For example, it retrives its state and does some processing with it
///         let me: &mut DelegateToMe = state.as_mut();
///         // do something with `me` ...
/// #       std::mem::drop(me) // use `me` to avoid a warning
///     }
/// }
/// ```
