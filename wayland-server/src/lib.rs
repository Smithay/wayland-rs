//! Server-side Wayland connector
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! Setting up the listening socket is done by the `create_display`
//! function, providing you a `Display` object and an `EventLoop`.
//!
//! On the event loop, you'll be able to register the globals
//! you want to advertize, as well as handlers for all ressources
//! created by the clients.
//!
//! You then integrate the wayland event loop in your main event
//! loop to run your compositor.
//!
//! # Handlers and event loop
//!
//! This crate mirrors the callback-oriented design of the
//! Wayland C library by using handler structs: each wayland
//! type defines a `Handler` trait in its module, which one
//! method for each possible requests this object can receive.
//!
//! To use it, you need to build a struct (or enum) that will
//! implement all the traits for all the requests you are interested
//! in. All methods of handler traits provide a default
//! implementation foing nothing, so you don't need to write
//! empty methods for events you want to ignore. You also need
//! to declare the handler capability for your struct using
//! the `declare_handler!(..)` macro. A single struct can be
//! handler for several wayland interfaces at once.
//!
//! ## Example of handler
//!
//! ```ignore
//! /*  writing a handler for an wl_foo interface */
//! // import the module of this interface
//! use wl_foo;
//!
//! struct MyHandler { /* some fields to store state */ }
//!
//! // implement handerl trait:
//! impl wl_foo::Handler for MyHandler {
//!     fn a_request(&mut self,
//!                  evlh: &mut EventLoopHandle,
//!                  client: &Client,
//!                  me: &wl_foo::WlFoo,
//!                  arg1, arg2, // the actual args of the request
//!     ) {
//!         /* handle the request */
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! // declare the handler capability
//! // this boring step is necessary because Rust's type system is
//! // not yet magical enough
//! declare_handler!(MyHandler, wl_foo::Handler, wl_foo::WlFoo);
//! ```
//!
//! ## Event Loop and handlers
//!
//! In your initialization code, you'll need to instanciate
//! your handler and give it to the event queue:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let handler_id = event_loop.add_handler(MyHandler::new());
//! ```
//!
//! Then, you can register your wayland objects to this handler:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // This type info is necessary for safety, as at registration
//! // time the event_loop will check that the handler you
//! // specified using handler_id has the same type as provided
//! // as argument, and that this type implements the appropriate
//! // handler trait.
//! event_loop.register::<_, MyHandler>(&my_object, handler_id);
//! ```
//!
//! You can have several handlers in the same event loop,
//! but they cannot share their state without synchronisation
//! primitives like `Arc`, `Mutex` and friends, so if two handlers
//! need to share some state, you should consider building them
//! as a single struct.
//!
//! A given wayland object can only be registered to a single
//! handler at a given time, re-registering it to a new handler
//! will overwrite the previous configuration.
//!
//! Handlers can be created, and objects registered to them
//! from within a handler method, using the `&EventLoopHandle`
//! argument.
//!
//! ## Globals declaration
//!
//! Declaring a global is quite similar to declaring a handler
//! for a ressource. But this time via the `GlobalHandler<R>` trait.
//!
//! This trait declares a single method, `bind`, which is called
//! whenever a client binds this global, providing you with
//! a ressource object representing the newly-created global.
//!
//! You can do what you please with this object, storing it for
//! later if you'll need to send it events, or just let it go
//! go out of scope after having registered it to the appropriate
//! handler.
//!
//! To register globals on the event loop, you need the
//! `register_global` method:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! struct MyHandler { /* ... */ }
//!
//! // creating a handler for the global wl_foo
//! impl GlobalHandler<WlFoo> for MyHandler {
//!     fn bind(&mut self,
//!             evlh: &mut EventLoopHandle,
//!             client: &Client,
//!             global: WlFoo
//!     ) {
//!         /* do something with it */
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! /* ... */
//!
//! // then somewhere in the initialization code
//! let handler_id = event_loop.add_handler(MyHandler::new());
//! // bind this handler to a global for interface wl_foo version 3
//! // specifying the types is mandatory, and compability of this
//! // handler with the global is checked at registration time.
//! let foo = event_loop.register_global::<WlFoo, MyHandler>(handler_is, 3);
//! // foo contains a handle to the global, that you can use later
//! // to destroy it:
//! foo.destroy();
//! // if you don't plan to ever destroy this global, you can ignore
//! // this return value, letting it out of scope will not destroy
//! // the global.
//! ```
//!
//! ## Event loop integration
//!
//! Once the setup phase is done, you can integrate the
//! event loop in the main event loop of your program.
//!
//! Either all you need is for it to run indefinitely (external
//! events are checked in an other thread?):
//!
//! ```ignore
//! event_loop.run();
//! ```
//!
//! Or you can integrate it with more control:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! loop {
//!     // flush events to client sockets
//!     display.flush_clients();
//!     // receive request from clients and dispatch them
//!     // blocking if no request is pending for at most
//!     // 10ms
//!     event_loop.dispatch(Some(10)).unwrap();
//!     // then you can check events from other sources if
//!     // you need to
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Protocols integration
//!
//! This crate provides the basic primitives as well as the
//! core wayland protocol (in the `protocol` module), but
//! other protocols can be integrated from XML descriptions.
//!
//! The the crate `wayland_scanner` and its documentation for
//! details about how to do so.
