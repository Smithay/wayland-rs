//! Server-side Wayland connector
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! This crate provides the interfaces and machinery to safely create servers
//! for the wayland protocol. It is a rust wrapper around the `libwayland-server.so`
//! C library.
//!
//! The wayland protocol revolves around the creation of various objects and the exchange
//! of messages associated to these objects. Whenever a client connects, a `Display` object
//! is automatically created in their object space, which they use as a root to create new
//! objects and bootstrap their state.
//!
//! ## Protocol and messages handling model
//!
//! The protocol being bi-directional, you can send and receive messages. Sending messages is
//! done via methods of `Resource<_>` objects, receiving and handling them is done by providing
//! implementations.
//!
//! ### Resources
//!
//! The protocol and message model is very similar to the one of `wayland-client`, with the
//! main difference being that the handles to objects are represented by the `Resource<I>`
//! type.
//!
//! These resources are used to send messages to the clients (they are called "events" in the
//! wayland context). This is done by the `Resource::<I>::send(..)` method.
//!
//! There is not a 1 to 1 mapping between `Resource<I>` instances and protocol objects. Rather,
//! you can think of `Resource<I>` as an `Rc`-like handle to a wayland object. Multiple instances
//! of it can exist referring to the same protocol object.
//!
//! Similarly, the lifetimes of the protocol objects and the `Resource<I>` are not tighly tied.
//! As protocol objects are created and destroyed by protocol messages, it can happen that an object
//! gets destroyed while one or more `Resource<I>` still refers to it. In such case, these resources
//! will be disabled and their `alive()` method will start to return `false`. Events that are
//! subsequently sent to them are ignored.
//!
//! ### Implementations
//!
//! To receive and process messages from the clients to you (in wayland context they are
//! called "requests"), you need to provide an `Implementation` for each wayland object
//! created in the protocol session. Whenever a new protocol object is created, you will
//! receive a `NewResource<I>` object. Providing an implementation via its `implement()` method
//! will turn it into a regular `Resource<I>` object.
//!
//! **All objects must be implemented**, even if it is an implementation doing nothing.
//! Failure to do so (by dropping the `NewResource<I>` for example) can cause future fatal
//! protocol errors if the client tries to send a request to this object.
//!
//! An implementation is just a struct implementing the `Implementation<Resource<I>, I::Request>`
//! trait, where `I` is the interface of the considered object:
//!
//! ```
//! // Example implementation for the wl_surface interface
//! use wayland_server::Resource;
//! use wayland_server::protocol::wl_surface;
//! use wayland_server::commons::Implementation;
//!
//! struct MyImpl {
//!    // ...
//! }
//!
//! impl Implementation<Resource<wl_surface::WlSurface>, wl_surface::Request> for MyImpl {
//!     fn receive(&mut self, msg: wl_surface::Request, resource: Resource<wl_surface::WlSurface>) {
//!         // process the message...
//!     }
//! }
//! # fn main() {}
//! ```
//!
//! The trait is also automatically implemented for `FnMut(I::Request, Resource<I>)` closures,
//! so you can use them for simplicity if a full struct would be too cumbersome.
//!
//! The `Resource<I>` passed to your implementation is garanteed to be alive (as it just received
//! a request), unless the exact message received is a destructor (which is indicated in the API
//! documentations).
//!
//! ## Event loops and general structure
//!
//! The core of your server is the `Display` object. It represent the ability of your program to
//! process wayland messages. Once this object is created, you can configure it to listen on one
//! or more sockets for incoming client connections (see the `Display` docs for details).
//!
//! The crate also provides an event loop structure. An `EventLoop` is automatically created at the
//! same time as the `Display`, and it will handle the connections of your wayland clients. See the
//! `EventLoop` API documentation for explanations of its use.
//!
//! It is also possible to both create other event loops and insert other kind of sources of events
//! to the event loops. These functions are typically useful to integrate, as a wayland compositor,
//! with other parts of the system (typically listening on file destrictor describing input devices).
//! Adding sources to an event loop is done via the `LoopToken` type, that is retrieved by the
//! `token()` method of `EventLoop`. See their documentations for more details.
