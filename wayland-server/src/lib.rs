//! Interface for interacting with the Wayland protocol, server-side.
//!
//! ## General concepts
//!
//! This crate is structured around four main objects: the [`Display`] and [`DisplayHandle`] structs,
//! resources (objects implementing the [`Resource`] trait), and the [`Dispatch`] trait.
//!
//! The [`Display`] is the heart of this crate, it represents the protocol state of your Wayland server, and
//! takes care of processing messages from clients. You'll need to integrate it in your event loop (see its
//! documentation for details). From it you can retrieve the [`DisplayHandle`], which is a clonable handle to
//! the Wayland state and is the type used to actually interact with the protocol.
//!
//! Each of the Wayland object you can manipulate is represented by a struct implementing the [`Resource`]
//! trait. Thos structs are automatically generated from the wayland XML protocol specification. This crate
//! provides the types generated from the core protocol in the [`protocol`] module. For other standard
//! protocols, see the `wayland-protocols` crate.
//!
//! ## Request dispatching and the [`Dispatch`] trait
//!
//! The request dispatching logic provided by this crate is build around the [`Dispatch`] trait. During the
//! dispatching process (in [`Display::dispatch_clients()`]), all requests sent by clients are read from
//! their respective process and delivered to your processing logic, by invoking methods on the various
//! [`Dispatch`] implementations of your `State` struct. In this paradigm, your `State` needs to implement
//! `Dispatch<O, _>` for every Wayland object `O` it needs to process events for.
//!
//! However, implementing all those traits on your own is a lot of (often uninteresting) work. To make this
//! easier a composition mechanism is provided using the [`delegate_dispatch!`] macro. This way, another
//! library (such as Smithay) can provide generic [`Dispatch`] implementations that you can reuse on your
//! own app by delegating those objects to that provided implementation. See the documentation of those
//! traits and macro for details.
//!
//! ## Globals
//!
//! The entry point of the protocol for clients goes through the protocol globals. Each global represents a
//! capability of your compositor, a peripheral it has access to, or a protocol extension it supports.
//! Globals are created by you using [`DisplayHandle::create_global()`], and require your `State` to
//! implement the [`GlobalDispatch`] trait for the interface associated with that global.
//!
//! ## Logging
//!
//! This crate can generate some runtime error message (notably when a protocol error occurs). By default
//! those messages are printed to stderr. If you activate the `log` cargo feature, they will instead be
//! piped through the `log` crate.
//!
//! ## Advanced use
//!
//! ### Bypassing [`Dispatch`]
//!
//! It may be that for some of your objects, handling them via the [`Dispatch`] trait is impractical. In
//! those contexts, this crate also provides some escape-hatches to directly interface with the low-level
//! APIs from `wayland-backend`, allowing you to register callbacks for those objects by directly providing
//! implementations of the backend [`ObjectData`](crate::backend::ObjectData) trait.
//! See [`Client::create_resource_from_objdata()`] and [`DataInit::custom_init()`].
//!
//! ### Interaction with FFI
//!
//! It can happen that you'll need to interact with Wayland states accross FFI, such as for example when
//! interfacing with the graphics stack for enabling hardware acceleration for clients.
//!
//! In this case, you'll need to do it in two steps, by explicitly working with `wayland-backend`, adding
//! it to your dependencies and enabling its `server_system` feature.
//!
//! Then, you'll generally need:
//!
//! - The `*mut wl_display` pointer, that you can retrieve by first retrieving the
//!   [`Backend`](crate::backend::Backend) using [`Display::backend()`], and then invoke
//!   [`.handle()`][backend::Backend::handle()][`.display_ptr()`][backend::Handle::display_ptr()].
//! - The `*mut wl_resource` pointers for the objects you need to share, by first getting the
//!   [`ObjectId`](crate::backend::ObjectId) using the [`Resource::id()`] method, and then
//!   the `ObjectId::as_ptr()` method.
//!
//! If you need to receive pointers from FFI, you can make [`ObjectId`]s from the `*mut wl_resource` pointers
//! using `ObjectId::from_ptr()`, and then make the resources using [`Resource::from_id`].
