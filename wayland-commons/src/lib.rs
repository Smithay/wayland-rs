//! Common definitions for wayland
//!
//! This crate hosts common type and traits used to represent wayland messages
//! and routines in the `wayland-client` and `wayland-server` crates.
//!
//! This notably includes the `Interface` trait, which can exhaustively describe
//! any wayland interface. Its implementations are intended to be generated by the
//! `wayland-scanner` crate.
//!
//! The principal user-facing definition provided by this crate is the `Implementation`
//! trait, which as a user of `wayland-client` or `wayland-server` you will be using
//! to define objects able to handle the messages your program receives. Note that
//! this trait is auto-implemented for closures with appropriate signature, for
//! convenience.
