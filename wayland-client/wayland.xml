    <description summary="global registry object">
      The global registry object.  The server has a number of global
      objects that are available to all clients.  These objects
      typically represent an actual object in the server (for example,
      an input device) or they are singleton objects that provide
      extension functionality.

      When a client creates a registry object, the registry object
      will emit a global event for each global currently in the
      registry.  Globals come and go as a result of device or
      monitor hotplugs, reconfiguration or other events, and the
      registry will send out global and global_remove events to
      keep the client up to date with the changes.  To mark the end
      of the initial burst of events, the client can use the
      wl_display.sync request immediately after calling
      wl_display.get_registry.

      A client can bind to a global object by using the bind
      request.  This creates a client-side handle that lets the object
      emit events to the client and lets the client invoke requests on
      the object.

  <interface name="wl_surface" version="3">
    <description summary="an onscreen surface">
      A surface is a rectangular area that is displayed on the screen.
      It has a location, size and pixel contents.

      The size of a surface (and relative positions on it) is described
      in surface local coordinates, which may differ from the buffer
      local coordinates of the pixel content, in case a buffer_transform
      or a buffer_scale is used.

      A surface without a "role" is fairly useless, a compositor does
      not know where, when or how to present it. The role is the
      purpose of a wl_surface. Examples of roles are a cursor for a
      pointer (as set by wl_pointer.set_cursor), a drag icon
      (wl_data_device.start_drag), a sub-surface
      (wl_subcompositor.get_subsurface), and a window as defined by a
      shell protocol (e.g. wl_shell.get_shell_surface).

      A surface can have only one role at a time. Initially a
      wl_surface does not have a role. Once a wl_surface is given a
      role, it is set permanently for the whole lifetime of the
      wl_surface object. Giving the current role again is allowed,
      unless explicitly forbidden by the relevant interface
      specification.

      Surface roles are given by requests in other interfaces such as
      wl_pointer.set_cursor. The request should explicitly mention
      that this request gives a role to a wl_surface. Often, this
      request also creates a new protocol object that represents the
      role and adds additional functionality to wl_surface. When a
      client wants to destroy a wl_surface, they must destroy this 'role
      object' before the wl_surface.

      Destroying the role object does not remove the role from the
      wl_surface, but it may stop the wl_surface from "playing the role".
      For instance, if a wl_subsurface object is destroyed, the wl_surface
      it was created for will be unmapped and forget its position and
      z-order. It is allowed to create a wl_subsurface for the same
      wl_surface again, but it is not allowed to use the wl_surface as
      a cursor (cursor is a different role than sub-surface, and role
      switching is not allowed).

	The new size of the surface is calculated based on the buffer
	size transformed by the inverse buffer_transform and the
	inverse buffer_scale. This means that the supplied buffer
	must be an integer multiple of the buffer_scale.

	The x and y arguments specify the location of the new pending
	buffer's upper left corner, relative to the current buffer's upper
	left corner, in surface local coordinates. In other words, the
	x and y, combined with the new surface size define in which
	directions the surface's size changes.

	Surface contents are double-buffered state, see wl_surface.commit.

	The initial surface contents are void; there is no content.
	wl_surface.attach assigns the given wl_buffer as the pending
	wl_buffer. wl_surface.commit makes the pending wl_buffer the new
	surface contents, and the size of the surface becomes the size
	calculated from the wl_buffer, as described above. After commit,
	there is no pending buffer until the next attach.

	Committing a pending wl_buffer allows the compositor to read the
	pixels in the wl_buffer. The compositor may access the pixels at
	any time after the wl_surface.commit request. When the compositor
	will not access the pixels anymore, it will send the
	wl_buffer.release event. Only after receiving wl_buffer.release,
	the client may re-use the wl_buffer. A wl_buffer that has been
	attached and then replaced by another attach instead of committed
	will not receive a release event, and is not used by the
	compositor.

	Destroying the wl_buffer after wl_buffer.release does not change
	the surface contents. However, if the client destroys the
	wl_buffer before receiving the wl_buffer.release event, the surface
	contents become undefined immediately.

	If wl_surface.attach is sent with a NULL wl_buffer, the
	following wl_surface.commit will remove the surface content.

	When a client is animating on a wl_surface, it can use the 'frame'
	request to get notified when it is a good time to draw and commit the
	next frame of animation. If the client commits an update earlier than
	that, it is likely that some updates will not make it to the display,
	and the client is wasting resources by drawing too often.

	The frame request will take effect on the next wl_surface.commit.
	The notification will only be posted for one frame unless
	requested again. For a wl_surface, the notifications are posted in
	the order the frame requests were committed.

	The server must send the notifications so that a client
	will not send excessive updates, while still allowing
	the highest possible update rate for clients that wait for the reply
	before drawing again. The server should give some time for the client
	to draw and commit after sending the frame callback events to let them

	Input events happening outside of this region will try the next
	surface in the server surface stack. The compositor ignores the
	parts of the input region that fall outside of the surface.

	The input region is specified in surface local coordinates.

	Input region is double-buffered state, see wl_surface.commit.

	wl_surface.set_input_region changes the pending input region.
	wl_surface.commit copies the pending region to the current region.
	Otherwise the pending and current regions are never changed,
	except cursor and icon surfaces are special cases, see
	wl_pointer.set_cursor and wl_data_device.start_drag.

	The initial value for input region is infinite. That means the
	whole surface will accept input. Setting the pending input region
	has copy semantics, and the wl_region object can be destroyed
	immediately. A NULL wl_region causes the input region to be set
	to infinite.

	Surface state (input, opaque, and damage regions, attached buffers,

	request atomically applies all pending state, replacing the current
	state. After commit, the new pending state is as documented for each

	On commit, a pending wl_buffer is applied first, all other state
	second. This means that all coordinates in double-buffered state are
	relative to the new wl_buffer coming into use, except for

      <description summary="sets the buffer transformation">
	This request sets an optional transformation on how the compositor
	interprets the contents of the buffer attached to the surface. The
	accepted values for the transform parameter are the values for
	wl_output.transform.

	Buffer transform is double-buffered state, see wl_surface.commit.

	A newly created surface has its buffer transformation set to normal.

	wl_surface.set_buffer_transform changes the pending buffer
	transformation. wl_surface.commit copies the pending buffer
	transformation to the current one. Otherwise, the pending and current
	values are never changed.

	The purpose of this request is to allow clients to render content
	according to the output transform, thus permiting the compositor to
	use certain optimizations even if the display is rotated. Using
	hardware overlays and scanning out a client buffer for fullscreen
	surfaces are examples of such optimizations. Those optimizations are
	highly dependent on the compositor implementation, so the use of this
	request should be considered on a case-by-case basis.

	Note that if the transform value includes 90 or 270 degree rotation,
	the width of the buffer will become the surface height and the height
	of the buffer will become the surface width.

	If transform is not one of the values from the

	wl_surface.set_buffer_scale changes the pending buffer scale.
	wl_surface.commit copies the pending buffer scale to the current one.
	Otherwise, the pending and current values are never changed.

	The purpose of this request is to allow clients to supply higher
	resolution buffer data for use on high resolution outputs. Its
	intended that you pick the same	buffer scale as the scale of the
	output that the surface is displayed on.This means the compositor
	can avoid scaling when rendering the surface on that output.

	Note that if the scale is larger than 1, then you have to attach
	a buffer that is larger (by a factor of scale in each dimension)

	A scale larger than 1 means that the compositor will

	It is intended that scaling aware clients track the

      The global interface exposing sub-surface compositing capabilities.
      A wl_surface, that has sub-surfaces associated, is called the
      parent surface. Sub-surfaces can be arbitrarily nested and create
      a tree of sub-surfaces.

      The root surface in a tree of sub-surfaces is the main
      surface. The main surface cannot be a sub-surface, because
      sub-surfaces must always have a parent.

      A main surface with its sub-surfaces forms a (compound) window.
      For window management purposes, this set of wl_surface objects is
      to be considered as a single window, and it should also behave as
      such.

      The aim of sub-surfaces is to offload some of the compositing work
      within a window from clients to the compositor. A prime example is
      a video player with decorations and video in separate wl_surface
      objects. This should allow the compositor to pass YUV video buffer
      processing to dedicated overlay hardware when possible.

    <description summary="sub-surface interface to a wl_surface">
      An additional interface to a wl_surface object, which has been
      made a sub-surface. A sub-surface has one parent surface. A
      sub-surface's size and position are not limited to that of the parent.
      Particularly, a sub-surface is not automatically clipped to its
      parent's area.

      A sub-surface becomes mapped, when a non-NULL wl_buffer is applied
      and the parent surface is mapped. The order of which one happens
      first is irrelevant. A sub-surface is hidden if the parent becomes
      hidden, or if a NULL wl_buffer is applied. These rules apply
      recursively through the tree of surfaces.

      The behaviour of wl_surface.commit request on a sub-surface
      depends on the sub-surface's mode. The possible modes are
      synchronized and desynchronized, see methods
      wl_subsurface.set_sync and wl_subsurface.set_desync. Synchronized
      mode caches the wl_surface state to be applied when the parent's
      state gets applied, and desynchronized mode applies the pending
      wl_surface state directly. A sub-surface is initially in the
      synchronized mode.

      Sub-surfaces have also other kind of state, which is managed by
      wl_subsurface requests, as opposed to wl_surface requests. This
      state includes the sub-surface position relative to the parent
      surface (wl_subsurface.set_position), and the stacking order of
      the parent and its sub-surfaces (wl_subsurface.place_above and
      .place_below). This state is applied when the parent surface's
      wl_surface state is applied, regardless of the sub-surface's mode.
      As the exception, set_sync and set_desync are effective immediately.

      The main surface can be thought to be always in desynchronized mode,
      since it does not have a parent in the sub-surfaces sense.

      Even if a sub-surface is in desynchronized mode, it will behave as
      in synchronized mode, if its parent surface behaves as in
      synchronized mode. This rule is applied recursively throughout the
      tree of surfaces. This means, that one can set a sub-surface into
      synchronized mode, and then assume that all its child and grand-child
      sub-surfaces are synchronized, too, without explicitly setting them.

      If the wl_surface associated with the wl_subsurface is destroyed, the
      wl_subsurface object becomes inert. Note, that destroying either object
      takes effect immediately. If you need to synchronize the removal
      of a sub-surface to the parent surface update, unmap the sub-surface
      first by attaching a NULL wl_buffer, update parent, and then destroy
      the sub-surface.

      If the parent wl_surface object is destroyed, the sub-surface is
      unmapped.
