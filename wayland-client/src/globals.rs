/// This macro aims to simplify the specific but common case of
/// providing a callback to the `GlobalManager` that needs to
/// auto-bind all advertised instances of some specific globals
/// whenever they happen. Typically, your application will likely
/// want to keep track of all `wl_seat` and `wl_output` globals
/// to be able to correctly react to user input and their different
/// monitors.
///
/// The output of this macro is a closure, that can be given to
/// `GlobalManager::new_with_cb` as the callback argument.
///
/// Example use is typically:
///
/// ```no_run
/// # #[macro_use] extern crate wayland_client;
/// use wayland_client::GlobalManager;
/// # use wayland_client::{Display, Main, DispatchData};
/// use wayland_client::protocol::{wl_output, wl_seat};
///
/// # fn main() {
/// # let display = Display::connect_to_env().unwrap();
/// # let mut event_queue = display.create_event_queue();
/// # let seat_implementor: fn(Main<_>, DispatchData) = unimplemented!();
/// # let output_implementor: fn(Main<_>, DispatchData) = unimplemented!();
/// let globals = GlobalManager::new_with_cb(
///     &display.attach(event_queue.token()),
///     global_filter!(
///         // Bind all wl_seat with version 4
///         [wl_seat::WlSeat, 4, seat_implementor],
///         // Bind all wl_output with version 1
///         [wl_output::WlOutput, 1, output_implementor]
///     )
/// );
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// The supplied callbacks for each global kind must be an instance of a type
/// implementing the `GlobalImplementor<I>` trait. The argument provided to your
/// callback is a `Main` handle of the newly instantiated global, and you should assign it
/// to a filter in this callback if you plan to do so.. The error case happens if the server
/// advertised a lower version of the global than the one you requested, in which case you
/// are given the version it advertised in the error method, if you want to handle it graciously.
///
/// You can also provide closures for the various callbacks, in this case the errors will
/// be ignored. However, due to a lack of capability of rustc's inference, you'll likely need
/// to add some type annotation to your closure, typically something like this:
///
/// ```ignore
/// global_filter!(
///     [Interface, version, |proxy: Main<_>, dispatch_data| {
///         /* Setup the global as required */
///     }]
/// );
