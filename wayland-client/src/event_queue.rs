/// A trait providing an implementation for handling events a proxy through an [`EventQueue`].
///
/// ## General usage
///
/// You need to implement this trait on your `State` for every type of Wayland object that will be processed
/// by the [`EventQueue`] working with your `State`.
///
/// You can have different implementations of the trait for the same interface but different `UserData` type,
/// this way the events for a given object will be processed by the adequate implementation depending on
/// which `UserData` was assigned to it at creation.
///
/// The way this trait works is that the [`Dispatch::event()`] method will be invoked by the event queue for
/// every event received by an object associated to this event queue. Your implementation can then match on
/// the associated [`Proxy::Event`] enum and do any processing needed with that event.
///
/// In the rare case of an interface with *events* creating new objects (in the core protocol, the only
/// instance of this is the `wl_data_device.data_offer` event), you'll need to implement the
/// [`Dispatch::event_created_child()`] method. See the [`event_created_child!`](event_created_child!) macro
/// for a simple way to do this.
///
/// ## Modularity
///
/// To provide generic handlers for downstream usage, it is possible to make an implementation of the trait
/// that is generic over the last type argument, as illustrated below. Users will then be able to
/// automatically delegate their implementation to yours using the [`delegate_dispatch!`] macro.
///
/// As a result, when your implementation is instanciated, the last type parameter `State` will be the state
/// struct of the app using your generic implementation. You can put additional trait constraints on it to
/// specify an interface between your module and downstream code, as illustrated in this example:
///
/// ```
/// # // Maintainers: If this example changes, please make sure you also carry those changes over to the delegate_dispatch macro.
/// use wayland_client::{protocol::wl_registry, Dispatch};
///
/// /// The type we want to delegate to
/// struct DelegateToMe;
///
/// /// The user data relevant for your implementation.
/// /// When providing delegate implementation, it is recommended to use your own type here, even if it is
/// /// just a unit struct: using () would cause a risk of clashing with an other such implementation.
/// struct MyUserData;
///
/// // Now a generic implementation of Dispatch, we are generic over the last type argument instead of using
/// // the default State=Self.
/// impl<State> Dispatch<wl_registry::WlRegistry, MyUserData, State> for DelegateToMe
/// where
///     // State is the type which has delegated to this type, so it needs to have an impl of Dispatch itself
///     State: Dispatch<wl_registry::WlRegistry, MyUserData>,
///     // If your delegate type has some internal state, it'll need to access it, and you can
///     // require it by adding custom trait bounds.
///     // In this example, we just require an AsMut implementation
///     State: AsMut<DelegateToMe>,
/// {
///     fn event(
///         state: &mut State,
///         _proxy: &wl_registry::WlRegistry,
///         _event: wl_registry::Event,
///         _udata: &MyUserData,
///         _conn: &wayland_client::Connection,
///         _qhandle: &wayland_client::QueueHandle<State>,
///     ) {
///         // Here the delegate may handle incoming events as it pleases.
///
///         // For example, it retrives its state and does some processing with it
///         let me: &mut DelegateToMe = state.as_mut();
///         // do something with `me` ...
/// #       std::mem::drop(me) // use `me` to avoid a warning
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// **Note:** Due to limitations in Rust's trait resolution algorithm, a type providing a generic

/// An event queue
///
/// This is an abstraction for handling event dispatching, that allows you to ensure
/// access to some common state `&mut State` to your event handlers.
///
/// Event queues are created through [`Connection::new_event_queue()`](crate::Connection::new_event_queue).
///
/// Upon creation, a wayland object is assigned to an event queue by passing the associated [`QueueHandle`]
/// as argument to the method creating it. All events received by that object will be processed by that event
/// queue, when [`dispatch_pending()`](EventQueue::dispatch_pending) or
/// [`blocking_dispatch()`](EventQueue::blocking_dispatch) is invoked.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ### Single queue app
///
/// If your app is simple enough that the only source of event to process is the Wayland socket and you only
/// need a single event queue, your main loop can be as simple as this:
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// use wayland_client::Connection;
///
/// let connection = Connection::connect_to_env().unwrap();
/// let mut event_queue = connection.new_event_queue();
///
/// /*
///  * Here your initial setup
///  */
/// # struct State {
/// #     exit: bool
/// # }
/// # let mut state = State { exit: false };
///
/// // And the main loop:
/// while !state.exit {
///     event_queue.blocking_dispatch(&mut state).unwrap();
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The [`blocking_dispatch()`](EventQueue::blocking_dispatch) will wait (by putting the thread to sleep)
/// until there are some events from the server that can be processed, and all your actual app logic can be
/// done in the callbacks of the [`Dispatch`] implementations, and in the main `loop` after the
/// `blocking_dispatch()` call.
///
/// ### Multi-thread multi-queue app
///
/// In a case where you app is multithreaded and you want to process events in multiple thread, a simple
/// pattern is to have one [`EventQueue`] per thread processing Wayland events.
///
/// With this pattern, each thread can use [`EventQueue::blocking_dispatch()`](EventQueue::blocking_dispatch
/// on its own event loop, and everything will "Just Work".
///
/// ### Single-queue guest library
///
/// If your code is some library code that will act on a Wayland connection shared by the main program, it is
/// likely you should not trigger socket reads yourself and instead let the main app take care of it. In this
/// case, to ensure your [`EventQueue`] still makes progress, you should regularly invoke
/// [`EventQueue::dispatch_pending()`](EventQueue::dispatch_pending) which will process the events that were
/// enqueued in the inner buffer of your [`EventQueue`] by the main app reading the socket.
///
/// ### Integrating the event queue with other sources of events
///
/// If your program needs to monitor other sources of events alongside the Wayland socket using a monitoring
/// system like `epoll`, you can integrate the Wayland socket into this system. This is done with the help
/// of the [`EventQueue::prepare_read()`](EventQueue::prepare_read) method. You event loop will be a bit more
/// explicit:
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # use wayland_client::Connection;
/// # let connection = Connection::connect_to_env().unwrap();
/// # let mut event_queue = connection.new_event_queue();
/// # let mut state = ();
///
/// loop {
///     // flush the outgoing buffers to ensure that the server does receive the messages
///     // you've sent
///     event_queue.flush().unwrap();
///
///     // (this step is only relevant if other threads might be reading the socket as well)
///     // make sure you don't have any pending events if the event queue that might have been
///     // enqueued by other threads reading the socket
///     event_queue.dispatch_pending(&mut state).unwrap();
///
///     // This puts in place some internal synchronization to prepare for the fact that
///     // you're going to wait for events on the socket and read them, in case other threads
///     // are doing the same thing
///     let read_guard = event_queue.prepare_read().unwrap();
///
///     /*
///      * At this point you can invoke epoll(..) to wait for readiness on the multiple FD you
///      * are working with, and read_guard.connection_fd() will give you the FD to wait on for
///      * the Wayland connection
///      */
/// # let wayland_socket_ready = true;
///
///     if wayland_socket_ready {
///         // If epoll notified readiness of the Wayland socket, you can now proceed to the read
///         read_guard.read().unwrap();
///         // And now, you must invoke dispatch_pending() to actually process the events
///         event_queue.dispatch_pending(&mut state).unwrap();
///     } else {
///         // otherwise, some of your other FD are ready, but you didn't receive Wayland events,
///         // you can drop the guard to cancel the read preparation
///         std::mem::drop(read_guard);
///     }
///
///     /*
///      * There you process all relevant events from your other event sources
///      */
/// }

/// # Usage
///
/// For example, say you want to delegate events for [`WlRegistry`](crate::protocol::wl_registry::WlRegistry)
/// to the struct `DelegateToMe` for the [`Dispatch`] documentatione example.
///
/// ```
/// use wayland_client::{delegate_dispatch, protocol::wl_registry};

/// # struct DelegateToMe;
/// # struct MyUserData;
/// #
/// # impl<State> Dispatch<wl_registry::WlRegistry, MyUserData, State> for DelegateToMe
