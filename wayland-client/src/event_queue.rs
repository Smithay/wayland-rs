/// An event queue for protocol messages
///
/// Event dispatching in wayland is made on a queue basis, allowing you
/// to organize your objects into different queues that can be dispatched
/// independently, for example from different threads.
///
/// An `EventQueue` is not `Send`, and thus must stay on the thread on which
/// it was created. However the `Display` object is `Send + Sync`, allowing
/// you to create the queues directly on the threads that host them.
///
/// When a queue is dispatched (via the `dispatch(..)` or `dispatch_pending(..)` methods)
/// all the incoming messages from the server designated to objects associated with
/// the queue are processed sequentially, and the appropriate implementation for each
/// is invoked. When all messages have been processed these methods return.
///
/// There are two main ways to driving an event queue forward. The first way is the
/// simplest and generally sufficient for single-threaded apps that only process events
/// from wayland. It consists of using the `EventQueue::dispatch(..)` method, which will
/// take care of sending pending requests to the server, block until some events are
/// available, read them, and call the associated handlers:
///
/// ```no_run
/// # extern crate wayland_client;
/// # use wayland_client::{Display};
/// # let display = Display::connect_to_env().unwrap();
/// # let mut event_queue = display.create_event_queue();
/// loop {
///     // The dispatch() method returns once it has received some events to dispatch
///     // and have emptied the wayland socket from its pending messages, so it needs
///     // to be called in a loop. If this method returns an error, your connection to
///     // the wayland server is very likely dead. See its documentation for more details.
///     event_queue.dispatch(&mut (), |_,_,_| {
///         /* This closure will be called for every event received by an object not
///            assigned to any Filter. If you plan to assign all your objects to Filter,
///            the simplest thing to do is to assert this is never called. */
///         unreachable!();
///     }).expect("An error occurred during event dispatching!");
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The second way is more appropriate for apps that are either multithreaded (and need to process
/// wayland events from different threads conccurently) or need to react to events from different
/// sources and can't affort to just block on the wayland socket. It centers around three methods:
/// `Display::flush()`, `EventQueue::read_events()` and `EventQueue::dispatch_pending()`:
///
/// ```no_run
/// # extern crate wayland_client;
/// # use wayland_client::Display;
/// # let display = Display::connect_to_env().unwrap();
/// # let mut event_queue = display.create_event_queue();
/// loop {
///     // The first method, called on the Display, is flush(). It writes all pending
///     // requests to the socket. Calling it ensures that the server will indeed
///     // receive your requests (so it can react to them).
///     if let Err(e) = display.flush() {
///         if e.kind() != ::std::io::ErrorKind::WouldBlock {
///             // if you are sending a realy large number of request, it might fill
///             // the internal buffers of the socket, in which case you should just
///             // retry flushing later. Other errors are a problem though.
///             eprintln!("Error while trying to flush the wayland socket: {:?}", e);
///         }
///     }
///
///     // The second method will try to read events from the socket. It is done in two
///     // steps, first the read is prepared, and then it is actually executed. This allows
///     // lower contention when different threads are trying to trigger a read of events
///     // concurently
///     if let Some(guard) = event_queue.prepare_read() {
///         // prepare_read() returns None if there are already events pending in this
///         // event queue, in which case there is no need to try to read from the socket
///         if let Err(e) = guard.read_events() {
///             if e.kind() != ::std::io::ErrorKind::WouldBlock {
///                 // if read_events() returns Err(WouldBlock), this just means that no new
///                 // messages are available to be read
///                 eprintln!("Error while trying to read from the wayland socket: {:?}", e);
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
///     // Then, once events have been read from the socket and stored in the internal
///     // queues, they need to be dispatched to their handler. Note that while flush()
///     // and read_events() are global and will affect the whole connection, this last
///     // method will only affect the event queue it is being called on. This method
///     // cannot error unless there is a bug in the server or a previous read of events
///     // already errored.
///     event_queue.dispatch_pending(&mut (), |_,_,_| {}).expect("Failed to dispatch all messages.");
///
///     // Note that none of these methods are blocking, as such they should not be used
///     // as a loop as-is if there are no other sources of events your program is waiting on.
///
///     // The wayland socket can also be integrated in a poll-like mechanism by using
///     // the file descriptor provided by the `get_connection_fd()` method.
/// }
