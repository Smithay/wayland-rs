//! Client-side Wayland connector
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! Connection to the Wayland compositor is achieved by
//! the `default_connect()` function, which provides you
//! with a `WlDisplay` and an `EventQueue`.
//!
//! From the display, you'll retrieve the registry, from
//! which you can instanciate the globals you need. This
//! step being really similar in most cases, this crate
//! contains an utility struct `EnvHandler` which can do
//! this job for you. See its documentation for details.
//!
//! You then register your handlers for events to the
//! event queue, and integrate it in your main event loop.
//!
//! # Handlers and event queues
//!
//! This crate mirrors the callback-oriented design of the
//! Wayland C library by using handler structs: each wayland
//! type defines a `Handler` trait in its module, which one
//! method for each possible event this object can receive.
//!
//! To use it, you need to build a struct (or enum) that will
//! implement all the traits for all the events you are interested
//! in. All methods of handler traits provide a default
//! implementation foing nothing, so you don't need to write
//! empty methods for events you want to ignore. You also need
//! to declare the handler capability for your struct using
//! the `declare_handler!(..)` macro. A single struct can be
//! handler for several wayland interfaces at once.
//!
//! ## Example of handler
//!
//! ```ignore
//! /*  writing a handler for an wl_foo interface */
//! // import the module of this interface
//! use wl_foo;
//!
//! struct MyHandler { /* some fields to store state */ }
//!
//! // implement handerl trait:
//! impl wl_foo::Handler for MyHandler {
//!     fn an_event(&mut self,
//!                 evqh: &mut EventQueueHandle,
//!                 me: &wl_foo::WlFoo,
//!                 arg1, arg2, // the actual args of the event
//!     ) {
//!         /* handle the event */
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! // declare the handler capability
//! // this boring step is necessary because Rust's type system is
//! // not yet magical enough
//! declare_handler!(MyHandler, wl_foo::Handler, wl_foo::WlFoo);
//! ```
//!
//! ## Event Queues and handlers
//!
//! In your initialization code, you'll need to instanciate
//! your handler and give it to the event queue:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let handler_id = event_queue.add_handler(MyHandler::new());
//! ```
//!
//! Then, you can register your wayland objects to this handler:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // This type info is necessary for safety, as at registration
//! // time the event_queue will check that the handler you
//! // specified using handler_id has the same type as provided
//! // as argument, and that this type implements the appropriate
//! // handler trait.
//! event_queue.register::<_, MyHandler>(&my_object, handler_id);
//! ```
//!
//! You can have several handlers in the same event queue,
//! but they cannot share their state without synchronisation
//! primitives like `Arc`, `Mutex` and friends, so if two handlers
//! need to share some state, you should consider building them
//! as a single struct.
//!
//! A given wayland object can only be registered to a single
//! handler at a given time, re-registering it to a new handler
//! will overwrite the previous configuration.
//!
//! Handlers can be created, and objects registered to them
//! from within a handler method, using the `&EventQueueHandle`
//! argument.
//!
//! ## Event loop integration
//!
//! Once this setup is done, you can integrate the event queue
//! to the main event loop of your program:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! loop {
//!     // flush events to the server
//!     display.flush().unwrap();
//!     // receive events from the server and dispatch them
//!     // to handlers (might block)
//!     event_queue.dispatch().unwrap();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! For more precise control of the flow of the event queue
//! (and importantly non-blocking options), see `EventQueue`
//! documentation.
//!
//! # Protocols integration
//!
//! This crate provides the basic primitives as well as the
//! core wayland protocol (in the `protocol` module), but
//! other protocols can be integrated from XML descriptions.
//!
//! The the crate `wayland_scanner` and its documentation for
//! details about how to do so.
