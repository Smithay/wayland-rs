//! Interface for interacting with the Wayland protocol, client-side.
//!
//! ## General concepts
//!
//! This crate is structured around four main objects: the [`Connection`] and [`EventQueue`] structs,
//! proxies (objects implementing the [`Proxy`] trait), and the [`Dispatch`] trait.
//!
//! The [`Connection`] is the heart of this crate, it represents you connection to the Wayland server, and
//! you'll generally initialize it using the [`Connection::connect_to_env()`](Connection::connect_to_env)
//! method, which will attempt to open a Wayland connection following the configuration specified by the
//! environment.
//!
//! Once you have a [`Connection`], you can create an [`EventQueue`] from it. This [`EventQueue`] will take
//! care of processing events from the Wayland server and delivering it to you processing logic, in the form
//! of a state struct with several [`Dispatch`] implementations (see below).
//!
//! Each of the Wayland object you can manipulate is represented by a struct implementing the [`Proxy`]
//! trait. Thos structs are automatically generated from the wayland XML protocol specification. This crate
//! provides the types generated from the core protocol in the [`protocol`] module. For other standard
//! protocols, see the `wayland-protocols` crate.
//!
//! ## Event dispatching
//!
//! The core event dispatching logic provided by this crate is build around the [`EventQueue`] struct. In
//! this paradigm, receiving and processing events is a two-step process:
//!
//! - First events are read from the Wayland socket, for each event the backend figures with [`EventQueue`]
//!   manages it, and enqueues the event in an internal buffer of that queue.
//! - Then, the [`EventQueue`] empties its internal buffer by sequentially invoking the appropriate
//!   [`Dispatch::event()`] method on the `State` value that was provided to it.
//!
//! The main goal of this structure is to make your `State` accessible without synchronization to most of
//! your event-processing logic, to reduce the plumbing costs. See [`EventQueue`] documentation for
//! explanations of how to drive your event loop using it and explanation about when and how to use multiple
//! event queues in your app.
//!
//! ### The [`Dispatch`] trait and dispatch delegation
//!
//! In this paradigm, your `State` needs to implement `Dispatch<O, _>` for every Wayland object `O` it needs to
//! process events for. This is ensured by the fact that, whenever creating an object using the methods on
//! an other object, you need to pass a [`QueueHandle<State>`] from the [`EventQueue`] that will be
//! managing the newly created object.
//!
//! However, implementing all those traits on your own is a lot of (often uninteresting) work. To make this
//! easier a composition mechanism is provided using the [`delegate_dispatch!`] macro. This way, another
//! library (such as Smithay's Client Toolkit) can provide generic [`Dispatch`] implementations that you
//! can reuse on your own app by delegating those objects to that provided implementation. See the
//! documentation of those traits and macro for details.
//!
//! ## Getting started example
//!
//! As an overview of how this crate is used, here is a commented example of a program that connects to the
//! Wayland server and lists the globals this server advertized throught the `wl_registry`:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use wayland_client::{protocol::wl_registry, Connection, Dispatch, QueueHandle};
//! // This struct represents the state of our app. This simple app does not
//! // need any state, by this type still supports the `Dispatch` implementations.
//! struct AppData;
//!
//! // Implement `Dispatch<WlRegistry, ()> for out state. This provides the logic
//! // to be able to process events for the wl_registry interface.
//! //
//! // The second type parameter is the user-data of our implementation. It is a
//! // mechanism that allows you to associate a value to each particular Wayland
//! // object, and allow different dispatching logic depending on the type of the
//! // associated value.
//! //
//! // In this example, we just use () as we don't have any value to associate. See
//! // the `Dispatch` documentation for more details about this.
//! impl Dispatch<wl_registry::WlRegistry, ()> for AppData {
//!     fn event(
//!         _state: &mut Self,
//!         _: &wl_registry::WlRegistry,
//!         event: wl_registry::Event,
//!         _: &(),
//!         _: &Connection,
//!         _: &QueueHandle<AppData>,
//!     ) {
//!         //Â When receiving events from the wl_registry, we are only interested in the
//!         // `global` event, which signals a new available global.
//!         // When receiving this event, we just print its characteristics in this example.
//!         if let wl_registry::Event::Global { name, interface, version } = event {
//!             println!("[{}] {} (v{})", name, interface, version);
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! // The main function of our program
//! fn main() {
//!     // Create a Wayland connection by connecting to the server through the
//!     // environment-provided configuration.
//!     let conn = Connection::connect_to_env().unwrap();
//!
//!     // Retrieve the WlDisplay Wayland object from the connection. This object is
//!     // the starting point of any Wayland program, from which all other objects will
//!     // be created.
//!     let display = conn.display();
//!
//!     // Create an event queue for our event processing
//!     let mut event_queue = conn.new_event_queue();
//!     // An get its handle to associated new objects to it
//!     let qh = event_queue.handle();
//!
//!     // Create a wl_registry object by sending the wl_display.get_registry request
//!     // This method takes two arguments: a handle to the queue the newly created
//!     // wl_registry will be assigned to, and the user-data that should be associated
//!     // with this registry (here it is () as we don't need user-data).
//!     let _registry = display.get_registry(&qh, ());
//!
//!     // At this point everything is ready, and we just need to wait to receive the events
//!     // from the wl_registry, our callback will print the advertized globals.
//!     println!("Advertized globals:");
//!
//!     // To actually receive the events, we invoke the `sync_roundtrip` method. This method
//!     // is special and you will generally only invoke it during the setup of your program:
//!     // it will block until the server has received and processed all the messages you've
//!     // sent up to now.
//!     //
//!     // In our case, that means it'll block until the server has received our
//!     // wl_display.get_registry request, and as a reaction has sent us a batch of
//!     // wl_registry.global events.
//!     //
//!     // `sync_roundtrip` will then empty the internal buffer of the queue it has been invoked
//!     // on, and thus invoke our `Dispatch` implementation that prints the list of advertized
//!     // globals.
//!     event_queue.roundtrip(&mut AppData).unwrap();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Advanced use
//!
//! ### Bypassing [`Dispatch`]
//!
//! It may be that for some of your objects, handling them via the [`EventQueue`] is unpractical. For example
//! if processing the events from those objects don't require accessing some global state, and/or you need to
//! handle them in a context where cranking an event loop is unpractical.
//!
//! In those contexts, this crate also provides some escape-hatches to directly interface with the low-level
//! APIs from `wayland-backend`, allowing you to register callbacks for those objects that will be invoked
//! whenever they receive an event and *any* event queue from the program is being dispatched. Those
//! callbacks are more constrained: they don't get a `&mut State` reference, and must be threadsafe. See
//! [`Proxy::send_constructor`] for details about how to assign such callbacks to objects.
//!
//! ### Interaction with FFI
//!
//! It can happen that you'll need to interact with Wayland states accross FFI, a typical example would be if
//! you need to use the [`raw-window-handle`](https://docs.rs/raw-window-handle/) crate.
//!
//! In this case, you'll need to do it in two steps, by explicitly working with `wayland-backend`, adding
//! it to your dependencies and enabling its `client_system` feature.
//!
//! - If you need to send pointers to FFI, you can retrive the `*mut wl_proxy` pointers from the proxies by
//!   first getting the [`ObjectId`](crate::backend::ObjectId) using the [`Proxy::id()`] method, and then
//!   the `ObjectId::as_ptr()` method.
//! - If you need to receive pointers from FFI, you need to first create a
//!   [`Backend`](crate::backend::Backend) from the `*mut wl_display` using the `from_external_display()`
//!   method (see `wayland-backend` docs), and then make it into a [`Connection`] using
//!   [`Connection::from_backend()`]. Similarly, you can make [`ObjectId`]s from the `*mut wl_proxy` pointers
//!   using `ObjectId::from_ptr()`, and then make the proxies using [`Proxy::from_id`].
//!
//! ## Logging
//!
//! This crate can generate some runtime error message (notably when a protocol error occurs). By default
//! those messages are printed to stderr. If you activate the `log` cargo feature, they will instead be
//! piped through the `log` crate.
