//! FFI bindings to the wayland system libraries.
//!
//! The names exported by this crate should *not* be used directly, but through
//! the `ffi_dispatch` macro, like this:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! ffi_dispatch!(HANDLE_NAME, func_name, arg1, arg2, arg3);
//! ```
//!
//! Where `HANDLE_NAME` is the name of the handle generated if the cargo feature `dlopen` is on.
//!
//! For this to work, you must ensure every needed symbol is in scope (aka the static handle
//! if `dlopen` is on, the extern function if not). The easiest way to do this is to glob import
//! the appropriate module. For example:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! #[macro_use] extern crate wayland_sys;
//!
//! use wayland_sys::client::*;
//!
//! let display_ptr = unsafe {
//!         ffi_dispatch!(WAYLAND_CLIENT_HANDLE, wl_display_connect, ::std::ptr::null())
//! };
//! ```
//!
//! Each module except `common` corresponds to a system library. They all define a function named
//! `is_lib_available()` which returns whether the library could be loaded. They always return true
//! if the feature `dlopen` is absent, as we link against the library directly in that case.

// If compiling with neither the `client` or `server` feature (non-sensical but
