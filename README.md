# Wayland rust crates

This project contains rust crates for using the wayland protocol, both client side and server side.

This repository actually hosts 8 crates. The 3 main crates you'll likely want to use:

- **wayland-client** and **wayland-server** are the main crates for client and server side bindings
- **wayland-protocols** regroups bindings on the official protocol extentions available

There are also two auxilliary crates:

- **wayland-egl**, which is necessary client-side for OpenGL integration
- **wayland-cursor**, which helps with loading cursor images from the system themes for use in your apps

And finally 3 internal crates, that you'll need only for integrating a custom protocol extension or doing FFI:

- **wayland-scanner** is the crate used to convert the XML protocol specifications into rust code
- **wayland-backend** contains the actual implementation of the protocol logic. It actually provides two
  backends: a rust implementation of the protocol, and a backend using the system wayland libraries (for
  FFI contexts).
- **wayland-sys** is the bindings to the C wayland libraries, used by *wayland-backend*
